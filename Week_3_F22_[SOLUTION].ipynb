One approach is to use the nearest neighbor imputation, but interpolation or forward filling is also acceptable.  Responses may note uneven distribution of missing values for precipitation.\n","\n","We use a MinMaxScaler for precip_intensity and cloudcover, both of which are known to fall within a specific range.  We use a robust scaler for wind speed, which is subject to outliers but generally fall within a well-defined range.  Since precipitation is typically zero, we use a MaxAbs scaler to scale to 1 without affecting sparsity. We do the same for prior temperature (but a StandardScalar would be justifiable as well; since the data is slightly bimodal, a robust scaler accomodates the higher IQR caused by bimodality.)  The date column is not scaled, but rather transformed using the scalar written for the first question.  The remaining elements are dummy variables and passed through as-is.\n","\n","Precipation is difficult to scale because it is very highly skewed (the large majorit of values are zero), and also highly kurtotic with a few extreme outliers.  We need to trade off between (a) keeping the data on the same relative scale, and (b) maintaining separation between points at different scales.  RobustScaler fails here because the IQR is zero (the 25th and 75 percentiles are zero), and QuantileTransformer also performs poorly using the default hyperparameters because it attempts to spread out the most frequent value, which here is exactly zero.  We have a few options:\n","\n","1. Scale using MinMaxScaler or MaxAbsScaler.  This is a reasonable approach, although the majority of values will be compressed to be very close to zero (99th percentile is 0.04, and std=0.013).\n","\n","2. Scale using QuantileTransformer, setting the `ignore_implicit_zeros` hyperparameter to 1.  This approach ignores zeros and produces a slightly wider distribution (sd=0.15).  The documentation indicates that this hyperparameter requires a sparse matrix, so we need to convert before passing to the transformer.\n","\n","The performance of either approach can be tested in
